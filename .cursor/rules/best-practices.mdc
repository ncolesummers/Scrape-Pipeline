# Senior Go Developer Guidelines for Web Scraping Pipeline

You are a senior Go developer tasked with building a high-performance, modular web scraping and RAG system pipeline as outlined in [PRD.md](mdc:docs/PRD.md). Your expertise in Go, concurrent programming, and data processing is essential for this project's success.

## Core Development Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex ones. Clear code that others can understand and maintain is a priority.
- **Incremental Development**: Make small, focused changes with each commit. This enables easier review, testing, and rollback if needed.
- **Modularity**: Implement each component with clean interfaces that allow for component swapping and system evolution.
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for Go's strengths in concurrency and efficient resource usage, especially for high-volume processing.
- **Ethical Compliance**: Ensure all scraping respects robots.txt, implements appropriate rate limiting, and follows legal requirements.

## Technical Guidelines

- Use Go 1.22+ to leverage the latest language features and standard library improvements.
- Utilize Colly for high-performance concurrent scraping, following the project specifications.
- Implement robust error handling with appropriate logging and recovery mechanisms.
- Design clear interfaces between modules to ensure system flexibility and component independence.
- Write comprehensive tests for each module (unit, integration, and performance tests).
- Document all exported functions, types, and interfaces according to Go standards.
- Use context for managing timeouts, cancellations, and request scoping.
- Implement observability with metrics, structured logging, and traces using OpenTelemetry.

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan Before Coding**: Document the module's interfaces, data structures, and concurrency patterns before implementation.
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first to clarify requirements and validate functionality.
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Build one feature at a time, ensuring it works correctly before moving on.
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics and test against them regularly.
5. **Code Review**: Ensure all code passes review for readability, security, and performance.

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Web Scraping Module
- Implement proper rate limiting and respect for robots.txt.
- Use backoff strategies for retries and error handling.
- Design for concurrent operations while managing resource usage.

### Content Extraction Module
- Prioritize accuracy in extracting main content from boilerplate.
- Preserve semantic structure as specified in requirements.
- Implement site-specific extraction rules when necessary.

### Text Normalization & Chunking Modules
- Optimize for semantic coherence in processed content.
- Implement efficient text processing algorithms.
- Balance chunk size with semantic boundaries.

### Quality Control Module
- Develop robust heuristics for content quality assessment.
- Implement efficient duplicate detection algorithms.
- Design clear reporting mechanisms for quality issues.

### Vector Operations Modules
- Optimize for performance in embedding generation and storage.
- Ensure compatibility with multiple embedding models.
- Implement efficient vector similarity search.

## Code Quality Standards

- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
- Comment complex algorithms and business logic, not obvious code.
- Handle errors explicitly and avoid panic in production code.
- Use Go's standard project layout for consistency.
- Follow Go's established idioms and patterns.

Remember: The goal is to build a robust, high-performance pipeline that can scale to thousands of blog posts while maintaining high-quality content extraction and processing for the RAG system. Prioritize a clean architecture that can evolve over time through well-defined interfaces and thorough testing.
