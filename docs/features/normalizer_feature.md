# Feature: Text Normalization Module

## Feature Description
The Text Normalization Module standardizes and cleans extracted content from web pages to ensure consistent, high-quality text for downstream processing in the RAG pipeline. This module transforms raw extracted content into a normalized format that's optimized for chunking, embedding, and eventual retrieval.

## Business Value
- **Improves Quality**: Ensures consistent text formatting across different content sources
- **Increases Relevance**: Enhances the quality of embeddings by removing noise and standardizing format
- **Reduces Errors**: Minimizes issues caused by inconsistent text formatting in downstream components
- **Enhances Efficiency**: Optimizes text for more efficient processing and storage

## Success Metrics
- **Text Quality Score**: Measure of text cleanliness and formatting consistency (target: 95%+)
- **Embedding Quality**: Improvement in embedding quality with normalized vs. raw text (target: 20%+ improvement)
- **Processing Speed**: Time taken to normalize content (target: <50ms per article)
- **Error Rate**: Reduction in downstream errors due to text inconsistencies (target: <1%)

## Priority Framework
We will use a simple 3-factor prioritization framework:

1. **Impact** (1-5): Effect on overall system quality and user experience
2. **Effort** (1-5): Development time and complexity (5 = lowest effort)
3. **Risk** (1-5): Technical uncertainty and implementation challenges (5 = lowest risk)

**Priority Score** = (Impact × 2) + Effort + Risk

For the Normalizer Module:
- Impact: 5 (Critical foundation for downstream components)
- Effort: 3 (Moderate implementation complexity)
- Risk: 4 (Well-understood problem with established solutions)
- **Priority Score: (5×2) + 3 + 4 = 17** (High)

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Transform extracted content into a consistent, normalized format
2. Preserve essential structural elements (headings, lists, paragraphs)
3. Handle text in multiple languages with appropriate normalization rules
4. Maintain document metadata while normalizing the content
5. Process various content types (articles, blog posts, documentation)
6. Provide configuration options for normalization strategies

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Process content in under 50ms per article (average size)
2. Handle documents up to 100,000 words without excessive memory usage
3. Maintain 99.9% accuracy in content preservation
4. Support concurrent processing of multiple documents
5. Provide clear logs and metrics for monitoring performance
6. Implement appropriate error handling and recovery

## Limitations and Constraints
- Must work with Go's native text processing capabilities
- Should minimize external dependencies
- Must handle UTF-8 encoded text properly
- Should not rely on external services for core functionality

## Related Components
- Depends on: Extractor Module
- Required by: Chunker Module, Quality Control Module

## Technical Considerations
- Text normalization strategies should be configurable
- Implementation should allow for language-specific normalization rules
- Should handle edge cases like code blocks, tables, and special characters appropriately
