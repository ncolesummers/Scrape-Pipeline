# Scrape-Pipeline Production Readiness Plan

This document outlines the necessary steps to bring the Scrape-Pipeline project to production readiness. The plan addresses missing components, implementation priorities, testing strategies, and operational considerations.

## 1. Component Implementation Status

### Implemented Components
- ✅ **Scraper Module**: Basic implementation using Colly for efficient web scraping with rate limiting and robots.txt support
- ✅ **Extractor Module**: Implementation using go-readability for content extraction
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Basic configuration loading from YAML

### Missing Components
- ❌ **Normalizer Module**: Standardizes text formatting (not implemented)
- ❌ **Chunker Module**: Splits documents into appropriate-sized chunks (not implemented)
- ❌ **Quality Control Module**: Detects low-quality or duplicate content (not implemented)
- ❌ **Embedder Module**: Converts text chunks to vector embeddings (not implemented)
- ❌ **Vector Storage Module**: Stores and indexes vector embeddings (not implemented)
- ❌ **Observer Module**: Collects metrics, traces, and logs (not implemented)
- ❌ **Pipeline Integration**: Main pipeline logic connecting all components (partially implemented)

## 2. Implementation Priorities

| Priority | Component | Justification |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Normalizer Module | Foundation for downstream processing |
| 2 | Chunker Module | Required for efficient embedding generation |
| 3 | Quality Control Module | Ensures high-quality data for embedding |
| 4 | Observer Module | Critical for monitoring and debugging |
| 5 | Embedder Module | Core functionality for vector generation |
| 6 | Vector Storage Module | Required for storing embeddings |
| 7 | Pipeline Integration | Connects all components |

## 3. Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Components (2 weeks)
- Implement Normalizer Module
- Implement Chunker Module
- Implement Quality Control Module
- Implement basic Observer Module for logging
- Update integration tests

### Phase 2: Advanced Components (2 weeks)
- Implement Embedder Module with OpenAI integration
- Implement Vector Storage Module with Chroma support
- Enhance Observer Module with metrics and tracing
- Improve error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (1 week)
- Complete pipeline integration in main.go
- Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests
- Performance testing and optimization
- Documentation updates

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- All modules should have at least 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- End-to-end pipeline tests with mock websites
- Performance tests measuring throughput and latency

### Acceptance Testing
- Test against real-world websites
- Validate embedding quality
- Measure system resource usage

## 5. Documentation Requirements

- Code documentation (godoc format)
- Architecture documentation
- Operations manual
- Configuration guide
- Troubleshooting guide
- Example usage and API documentation

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling strategy
- Rate limiting across multiple instances
- Distributed scraping coordination

### Efficiency
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Streaming processing to avoid memory bottlenecks
- Batch processing for embedding generation

### Resource Requirements
- Minimum and recommended hardware specifications
- Memory sizing guidelines
- Disk space requirements for vector storage

## 7. Security Considerations

- Secure handling of API keys for embedding services
- TLS for all connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Robot exclusion protocol compliance

## 8. Operational Readiness

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Alerting rules and thresholds

### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose for local deployment
- Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Observability
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Health check endpoints
- Status dashboards

## 9. Timeframe and Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| MVP Completion | Core modules implemented and tested | End of Week 2 |
| Beta Release | All modules implemented, basic integration | End of Week 4 |
| Production Release | Full system with documentation and deployment | End of Week 5 |

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Rate limiting from target sites | High | Medium | Implement adaptive rate limiting and retry strategies |
| Memory consumption issues | High | Medium | Implement streaming processing and memory monitoring |
| API costs for embedding services | Medium | High | Implement caching and batch processing |
| Changes to target site structure | Medium | High | Implement robust extraction and regular testing |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Profiling and optimization in development |

## 11. Next Steps

1. Create GitHub issues for each missing component
2. Implement test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline
3. Begin development of the Normalizer module
4. Schedule weekly progress reviews
5. Create release milestones in GitHub
