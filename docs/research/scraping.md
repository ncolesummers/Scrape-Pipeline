# Effective Techniques for Web Scraping and Preparing Blog Articles for RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require a robust pipeline to gather content from web sources, clean and structure it, and encode it for retrieval. Below we outline best practices for scraping thousands of blog posts locally, focusing on Go-based tools (Colly, GoQuery, Playwright for Go) and comparisons to TypeScript alternatives (Puppeteer, Playwright, Cheerio). We also cover content extraction, text preprocessing, chunking, and quality control to ensure the resulting knowledge base is high-quality and ready for efficient retrieval.

## Modern Web Scraping Approaches (Go vs TypeScript)

### Go-Based Libraries

 Go offers several powerful scraping libraries. Colly is a high-performance scraping framework with built-in concurrency, request scheduling, and support for features like rate-limiting and caching ￼. It’s known to handle large-scale scraping efficiently (benchmarks show ~2000 requests per second on a single core) while using minimal memory ￼. GoQuery provides jQuery-like HTML parsing in Go, making it easy to traverse and select elements (analogous to Cheerio in Node) ￼. For JavaScript-heavy pages, Go can use headless browser controllers like Playwright for Go or Rod/Chromedp to render content. Playwright’s Go port is essentially a binding to the Node.js Playwright – it spins up a Node process to control the browser ￼ – meaning Go hands off browser automation to Node under the hood. This yields the same capabilities as Playwright in TypeScript (multi-browser support, auto-waits, etc.), with Go handling the orchestration.

### TypeScript Alternatives

 In the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, Puppeteer (headless Chrome) and Playwright are dominant for dynamic content. Puppeteer is limited to Chromium-based browsers, while Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, and has official client libraries in multiple languages (JS/TS, Python, .NET, Java) ￼. Cheerio (for Node) parallels GoQuery, allowing fast HTML parsing without a browser. Generally, static sites or those with server-rendered HTML can be scraped faster with lightweight HTTP+DOM parsers (Colly+GoQuery or Axios+Cheerio), whereas single-page apps (SPAs) or heavily client-rendered sites require a headless browser (Playwright or Puppeteer). Go’s lack of an official Playwright API ￼ means using community libraries or Chrome DevTools Protocol clients (like Rod), which can be slightly more involved to set up but avoid requiring a separate Node runtime. In practice, both Go and TS solutions can achieve similar results – TypeScript might offer more out-of-the-box plugins (e.g. Puppeteer stealth plugins to evade detection), while Go offers raw speed and easy concurrency via goroutines ￼.

### Handling JavaScript and Running Locally

 When running locally, a headless browser will consume significant resources, so use it only for pages that truly need it. One approach is hybrid: use a fast HTTP fetch (Colly) to retrieve pages, and detect if content is missing or placeholders (indicative of JS requirements). If so, fall back to a headless browser for that page. Go’s Colly has recently added some JavaScript handling capabilities (via a JS engine) for simple cases ￼, but it’s not a full replacement for a real browser. If you must use a headless browser at scale, consider launching it with minimal overhead (disable images/CSS, etc.) and reusing the browser instance across pages. Tools like Playwright allow interception of resource requests so you can block images or other assets to speed up scraping ￼. Running headless Chrome/Firefox in a Docker container is an option, though some developers offload this to an external service to avoid dealing with browser binaries locally ￼. Since the goal is a local pipeline, ensure your machine has enough CPU/RAM if scraping many pages concurrently with headless browsers. Use headless mode (no GUI) and possibly throttle concurrency for heavy pages to avoid straining resources.

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

 Always respect the target site’s crawling policies. Check each site’s robots.txt to see if scraping is allowed or certain paths are disallowed. For example, Reuters’ robots.txt explicitly disallows known bot user-agents ￼ – indicating that many news sites try to keep scrapers out. While robots.txt is not legally binding in most jurisdictions, ignoring it can get your IP blocked or even invite legal letters in extreme cases. Rate limiting is crucial: scrape responsibly by inserting delays or using Colly’s built-in rate limiter to avoid overwhelming servers. Colly supports setting a delay between requests or max parallelism to adhere to polite crawling norms. Also, identify yourself (some scrapers set a custom user-agent like "MyScraper/1.0 (+email)"), or at least avoid the default Go HTTP user-agent which may be a red flag; Colly makes it easy to set a random or custom UA string on each request ￼. Ensure you handle cookies and login if needed (some sites may present a consent or login wall – it might be both unethical and impractical to bypass those without permission). Avoid scraping content behind paywalls or that contains personal data, as that could violate terms of service or laws (GDPR, CCPA) ￼ ￼.

### Avoiding Blocks & Long-Term Reliability

 Modern websites deploy anti-bot measures (IP banning, CAPTCHA, Cloudflare challenges, etc.) ￼. To mitigate this, use rotating user agents and proxies for long-running scrapers. Simply cycling through common browser user-agent strings can evade basic bot detection ￼. Incorporating proxy servers (residential or rotating proxies) helps distribute requests – though keep in mind free proxies are often unreliable and short-lived ￼. If you scrape from one machine/IP, implement exponential backoff on errors and possibly switch networks if available. Headless browsers themselves can be detected; Playwright and Puppeteer by default try to mask some signals, but using a stealth plugin or running in “headed” mode for a few crucial sites might reduce suspicion. It’s wise to build retry logic: e.g., if a request fails or returns a 429/503 status, wait and try again a few times. Colly provides callback hooks like OnError to catch failures and can retry or log them ￼. In practice, a combination of tactics works best: use sitemaps or feeds when available (many blogs offer RSS or XML sitemaps listing recent posts) to avoid heavy crawling ￼, schedule scraping during off-peak hours of the site, and monitor for any changes (if a site redesigns, your scrapers might break – keep the scraping code maintainable and modular to update selectors easily).

## Content Extraction & Cleaning

Once the raw HTML of a blog post is fetched, the next challenge is extracting the main article content while stripping away boilerplate. Blog pages usually contain headers, navigation menus, sidebars, footers, advertisements, and other elements not relevant to the article text. We need techniques to isolate the core content.

### Main Content Extraction

 A well-known approach is to use the Readability algorithm (from Arc90/Mozilla) or similar boilerplate removal algorithms. There are Go libraries implementing this, such as go-readability (go-shiori’s version) which “finds the main humanly readable content and metadata from an HTML page” by removing clutter like buttons, ads, and backgrounds ￼. These libraries analyze the HTML structure and text densities to identify the central content block (e.g. the <article> tag or the largest <div> of text). For example, the go-readability package can parse an HTML document and return an Article object containing the cleaned text, title, author, and other metadata ￼. In a Go scraping pipeline, one can hook this into Colly: use an OnHTML callback to grab the page’s HTML, then feed it to readability’s FromReader function to get the article text ￼. This approach has the advantage of being general – it doesn’t require writing site-specific parsing rules for each blog.

If you prefer not to rely on a full readability parser, you can use DOM traversal with GoQuery (or Cheerio in TS) to manually target the article content. Many blogs have a wrapping element with an identifiable class or tag (for instance, in one Hacker News example, the main content was within <div class="post"> ￼). You could select that element and then remove known unwanted sub-elements (like .sidebar, .ad-banner, etc.). However, maintaining a list of removals for every site can be tedious; algorithms like Readability or libraries like Trafilatura (a Python library with a Go port) use heuristics to do this automatically. In short, to ensure consistency across thousands of posts from different sites, using a content extraction library is a best practice. These libraries not only extract text but often capture the article’s metadata and can output a cleaner HTML of the article.

### Preserving Structure

 It’s important that cleaning the page doesn’t flatten all useful structure. Maintain the hierarchy of headings, paragraphs, lists, and emphasis from the original article. This structure provides valuable semantic context – e.g., headings can serve as summary of the section, list items might enumerate key points. Many extraction tools allow preserving basic HTML tags. For instance, go-readability’s fork can retain certain tags and even include images in the output text (an option TextWithImgTag: true will keep <img> tags for images in the content) ￼. When extracting, prefer to get HTML of the article’s content (sanitized of junk) and then you can post-process that HTML: keep <p>, <h1>-<h3>, <ul>/<ol> and their <li> items, <code> blocks, and <img> tags (or at least their alt text or captions). Remove any residual scripts, tracking pixels, or hidden elements. The goal is a clean, semantically-rich document representing the blog post. In practice, Readability-based tools will return a text or HTML snippet of just the article. For example, after using go-readability on a page, you can get article.Text (plain text) or article.Content (HTML content) and also access article.Meta for things like title, author, publication date ￼.

### Handling Images (for CLIP Embedding)

 If your RAG system will use image embeddings (e.g., using OpenAI’s CLIP or similar) for the blog images, you need to efficiently handle image extraction. First, decide if you will embed images as separate index items or incorporate them with text. Often, images are indexed separately with their own embedding (and maybe linked to the article via metadata). To extract images, you can use Colly/GoQuery to find all <img> tags within the article content after cleaning. Downloading thousands of images can be time-consuming, so consider these optimizations:
	-	Lazy Download: Only fetch images if you plan to use them. If many images are decorative or you won’t search by image content, you might skip them. Otherwise, you can use a pipeline (e.g., a worker pool in Go) to download images in parallel after extracting posts, to not slow down the text scraping.
	-	Reduce Size: For embedding, super high resolution isn’t necessary. You can fetch or downsample images to a reasonable size (CLIP models typically use 224×224 or 336×336 pixel inputs). If the blog provides thumbnails in HTML (e.g., srcset or specific thumbnail URLs), you might use those to save bandwidth.
	-	Metadata: Store image references in the content’s metadata or replace images in text with a placeholder like [Image: <caption or alt text>] so that the text embedding knows something was there. The alt text can be particularly useful – it often describes the image and can be fed into the text encoder (or at least stored as context).
	-	CLIP Processing: When ready to embed, ensure you preprocess images correctly (e.g., center-crop, normalize as required by CLIP). This can be done offline. The embeddings of images can be stored alongside text embeddings for retrieval. For example, if a user query might refer to “the chart shown in that blog post about X,” having the image encoded can help retrieve the article via the image content.

### Example – Content Extraction Workflow

 A practical flow used by one developer for news articles was: use Colly to fetch a site’s news sitemap for URLs, then visit each article URL and run the HTML through go-readability to get the content ￼ ￼. This approach smartly bypassed a lot of navigation by leveraging the site’s own feed of articles. The extracted content included title, author, date, and the main text, which they stored in a struct ￼. Implementing something similar for blogs can significantly simplify scraping – always check if a blog offers an index (RSS feed, sitemap, or JSON API) that lists posts and basic info. This reduces the need to crawl page by page and often provides metadata in a ready format (as seen in the Reuters sitemap XML snippet which contains title, publication date, keywords, etc. ￼).

After extraction, perform any additional cleaning: trim unnecessary whitespace, unescape HTML entities (so “&” becomes “&”), and normalize punctuation (e.g., sometimes WordPress smart quotes or dashes could be replaced with standard ones if consistency is needed). The end result should be a clean text (and/or HTML snippet) of the article content, plus structured metadata.

## Text Normalization for Embeddings

Before feeding the text into embedding models (whether CLIP’s text encoder, OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada, SBERT, etc.), some light preprocessing can improve embedding quality. However, modern transformer-based models are quite robust to raw text, so we avoid over-processing that could remove meaningful information ￼.

### Minimal Necessary Cleaning

 The consensus for state-of-the-art embeddings is to do as little as possible. For example, OpenAI experts suggest not removing punctuation or numbers wholesale, because these can affect meaning and semantic search performance ￼. Punctuation often guides the structure of sentences (imagine quotes, question marks, or commas – they all influence meaning), and numbers can carry key info (dates, version numbers, etc.). So, do not strip punctuation or digits in the final text used for embedding. A user on OpenAI’s forum summarized: “Removing punctuation can drastically change the meaning of text, and the point of embeddings is to enable semantic search. Numbers are important… their presence is important (even if their exact value isn’t).” ￼. In short, keep the text as natural as possible.

### Normalization Steps
 Focus on consistency and correctness rather than removal. Good steps include:
	-	Fix encoding issues: Ensure the text is UTF-8 and characters are rendered properly (no � replacements). Convert fancy quotes or bullets to plain equivalents if the model’s tokenizer might not recognize them.
	-	Lowercasing: This is optional. Many transformer models have a cased vocabulary (they distinguish “Apple” from “apple”). Unless your embedding model was trained on lowercased text only, it’s often fine to preserve case. Lowercasing everything can help reduce sparsity for models that aren’t case-sensitive, but it can also lose information (e.g., proper nouns, abbreviations). You might lowercase for older models, but for OpenAI Ada or CLIP, it’s probably not necessary ￼.
	-	Removing stopwords: Do not remove stopwords (common words like “the”, “and”, “is”). In semantic embeddings, those words provide context and structure. Removing them was beneficial for old bag-of-words models, but for transformers it can harm the semantic representation ￼.
	-	Special characters: Remove any residual HTML tags or markup if still present. Also remove non-textual artifacts (e.g., leftover \n in weird places, or Unicode zeros). Emoji or icons – decide based on use case; they might not be common in blog text, but if present and relevant, the model might handle them or you could replace them with a word (e.g., “:smile:” to “smiling face”).
	-	Spelling/Grammar: Embedding models will take the text as-is, so typos will produce a slightly different vector (though likely close if the typo is minor). If you have an automated way to spell-correct without altering meaning, you can consider it, but be cautious – incorrect “corrections” could distort meaning. Often, it’s not done unless the text is riddled with errors. A safer approach is just ensuring consistent spacing and punctuation (e.g., no unintentional double periods or weird punctuation sequences that came from HTML). The OpenAI advice is: if anything, focus on ensuring correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation rather than removing elements ￼.
	-	Domain-specific terms: Blogs might include jargon, code snippets, or hashtags. Treat these as normal text – don’t try to split or alter them (other than maybe adding a space before a hashtag if needed). Preservation is key: you want an embedding to capture those unique tokens as they are. If an acronym or code like OAuth2 is present, keep it intact (embedding models can handle unknown tokens or break them into subword units internally).

By keeping normalization light, we leverage the power of models to understand context. For instance, instead of aggressively stemming words (turning “generation” to “generat”), we leave the full word – the embedding space of a model like SBERT will place “generation” and “generating” close by itself, without us forcing it. Over-normalizing (as was common in older NLP pipelines) can actually reduce the model’s ability to do semantic matching ￼.

### Optimizing for CLIP vs Text Models

 If you plan to use CLIP specifically for text (CLIP has a Transformer-based text encoder), note that CLIP’s tokenizer has a fixed context length (e.g. 77 tokens for most CLIP models). If your chunks of text are longer than that, CLIP will truncate them. In such cases, ensure your chunking strategy (next section) keeps text segments short enough if using CLIP’s text embeddings. Otherwise, using a dedicated text embedding model (like OpenAI Ada or SBERT) for the textual part is common. These models often can handle a few hundred tokens of input. Regardless, the preprocessing principles are similar. In summary, retain as much information as possible in the text – let the embedding model learn what is important. Use normalization to correct or standardize text, not to throw away data.

## Document Chunking Strategies

After extracting and cleaning each blog article, we typically end up with a block of text (possibly with some structure). Directly embedding a whole article can be suboptimal if the article is long or covers multiple topics. Document chunking is the process of splitting articles into smaller pieces (chunks) that are indexed separately in the RAG system. This is crucial for efficient retrieval, as it allows the system to pull only the relevant piece of an article in response to a query, rather than an entire long document.

### Choosing Chunk Size

 The ideal chunk size balances context and specificity. Chunks need to be large enough to contain a meaningful amount of information (so the context of a query is preserved within a chunk), but not so large that they dilute relevance or exceed embedding limits. In practice, chunks on the order of a few hundred words or a few hundred tokens are common. A rule of thumb is often 200-500 tokens per chunk. Recent research suggests that a chunk size around 200 tokens with no overlap is a strong choice across many scenarios ￼. In fact, one technical evaluation found that using ~200-token segments (roughly a couple of paragraphs) gave consistently high retrieval performance, even outperforming some larger-chunk strategies in recall ￼. Smaller chunks mean more entries in your vector store, but each entry is more focused.

### Overlap vs. No Overlap

 Chunk overlap means repeating some content between adjacent chunks (e.g., the last sentence of chunk A is also the first sentence of chunk B) to ensure continuity. This helps when a query refers to something that spans a boundary. A common approach is to overlap by roughly 10-20% of the chunk length ￼. For example, with 300-word chunks, you might overlap by 30-60 words. This can improve the chances that relevant text isn’t split in a way that misses context ￼, but it comes at the cost of storing redundant info and potentially returning multiple chunks with the same content. If your chunks are small (~200 tokens), you might get away with no overlap or minimal overlap, relying on the retrieval step to grab multiple chunks if needed. Reducing overlap can also improve certain metrics by avoiding too much duplicate content in results ￼. A practical compromise is to start with no overlap and test retrieval quality – if you find the system sometimes misses context that was just at a chunk boundary, introduce a small overlap. As one practitioner noted, a chunk size of 512 tokens with ~20 token overlap worked well in their Q&A application ￼ – but optimal values vary with content and query style, so be ready to iterate ￼.

### Semantic or Structural Chunking

 Instead of arbitrary token counts, you can chunk along natural boundaries in the article. Leverage the blog’s structure: if an article has sections with subheadings, consider each section a chunk (or split further if sections are very long). If it’s mostly prose, you might split by paragraph, merging small paragraphs together until you reach a token limit. Tools like LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter follow a strategy of splitting by paragraphs/sentences and only breaking in the middle of a sentence if absolutely necessary. This often yields chunks that are easier to interpret (e.g., one chunk = one subtopic). The Chroma research report found that such a recursive splitting strategy with a modest chunk size tends to be effective and yields high recall ￼. In any case, maintain logical coherence in chunks – you wouldn’t want a chunk to start in the middle of a sentence or cut a list in half, if possible.

### Metadata Attachment

 Each chunk should carry metadata about its origin and context. This is vital for a RAG system to reconstruct answers or provide source citations. At minimum, attach the article URL or ID, the article title, and maybe the author and publication date to each chunk. This allows the QA system to say “According to Blog Title by Author on Date, …” if needed, or to filter results (e.g., only search chunks from a certain website or date range). You might also store the section header of that chunk (for example, metadata field section: "Introduction" if the chunk came from the intro section of the post). In Go, this can be handled by storing chunks as a struct with fields for text and metadata. For example, when scraping The Hacker News, the code collected metadata (title, author, date, categories) for each article before extracting the body ￼. You can similarly populate a struct like:

```go
type Chunk struct {
    Text      string
    SourceURL string
    Title     string
    Author    string
    Date      string
    Section   string
}
```

When splitting an article, each resulting Chunk gets the same SourceURL/Title/Author/Date, but a different Section (if applicable) and obviously its own Text content. If using a vector database, you’ll typically upsert each chunk’s embedding along with its metadata.

### Practical Tip – Avoiding Cuts in the Wrong Place

 Implement your chunking with awareness of sentence boundaries. If using Go, you might split by sentences (using a sentence tokenizer or a simple heuristic like splitting on “. ”) and accumulate sentences until the chunk token count threshold is reached. Or if the text is in HTML paragraphs, use those – for example, join two or three <p> elements per chunk as needed. This way, even without overlap, you rarely split a sentence. Also consider that some blogs have very short sections (one-liners) – in those cases you may merge two sections into one chunk to meet a minimum chunk length, so that the chunk has enough substance for the embedding to latch onto.

### Chunking & Retrieval Performance

 It’s worth noting that chunk size can impact both recall (ability to find relevant info) and precision (how much of retrieved text is on-point). Smaller chunks = higher precision, larger chunks = potentially higher recall (because more context per chunk). Empirical testing is key. Start with a baseline (say 300 tokens, 50 token overlap ￼) and evaluate the RAG system’s answers. If it’s often pulling multiple chunks from the same article to answer a question, you could try larger chunks. If it’s returning chunks that contain a lot of irrelevant surrounding text, try smaller chunks. The good news is that with a well-structured pipeline, you can re-chunk later if needed and re-index the vectors relatively easily.

## Quality Control & Validation

Building a long-term, large-scale knowledge base from scraped blogs requires vigilance in quality control. Here are important techniques for ensuring the data remains clean, deduplicated, and error-free:

### Content Quality Checks

 Not every fetched page will yield a good article. Some pages might be error messages, login pages, or simply very short updates. Implement checks after extraction to verify that the content looks like a real blog post. For example, set a minimum length threshold – if the extracted text is, say, under 50 words, flag it. It could be a false positive (maybe an empty article or a page that requires JavaScript that wasn’t handled). Also watch for tell-tale phrases in the text: if your content contains “404” or “Not Found” or “Please enable JavaScript to view this content,” then the scraper didn’t get what we wanted. These should be logged and perhaps re-scraped with a headless browser or skipped. Another approach is to ensure certain expected fields are present: e.g., every article chunk should have a title and some body text; if title extraction failed (empty title) or body is just a few words, that item is suspect. You can also utilize readability scores or even ML classifiers to judge if a text looks like an article. For instance, an extremely low readability (gibberish) might indicate parsing went wrong. In practice, simple heuristics catch most issues (length, presence of placeholder text, etc.), so start there.

### Deduplication (Exact & Near-Duplicate Removal)

 With thousands of blog posts, there’s a chance of duplicate content. Authors might repost content, or two blogs might syndicate the same article, etc. Duplicate chunks would waste space and could skew retrieval (you don’t need the same sentence indexed twice). Employ both exact matching and near-duplicate detection:
	-	Exact Duplicates: You can hash the cleaned text of each article (e.g., an MD5 or SHA256 of the text). Keep a set of seen hashes; if a new article’s hash matches one already seen, skip it or mark as duplicate. This catches exact copies.
	-	Near-Duplicates: For slight variations (for example, one site adds a footer “Originally published on X” or minor edits), use a SimHash or similar algorithm. SimHash generates a fingerprint for a document such that similar documents have fingerprints with small Hamming distances ￼. It’s commonly used in web crawling to detect near-duplicate pages ￼. There are libraries in many languages (e.g., Python’s simhash or Go implementations) to compute this. By clustering or comparing SimHash values, you can detect articles that are, say, 90% identical. Another method is to compare embeddings: you could embed full articles with a general model and measure cosine similarity, but that’s heavier than SimHash which is designed for this task. If two articles are nearly identical, you might choose one (perhaps the original source, if you can tell via metadata) to keep. This ensures your RAG system doesn’t store redundant info. Keep in mind, if two articles cover the same topic but are written differently, that’s not a duplicate – that’s just similar content. Deduping is about essentially identical text.
	-	Within-article overlap: We should clarify that overlapping chunks from the same article are expected (due to our deliberate chunk overlap). That’s not an error; those will share some text. Dedup checks should be more at the article level. For chunk-level, you might remove exact duplicate chunks (e.g., if an article has a repetitive boilerplate that ends up creating identical text in two chunks, which can happen if the article had a template snippet repeated). But generally, if chunking is done right, each chunk is unique or overlaps only partially. If you accidentally indexed the same article twice (maybe via two different URLs), dedup will catch that by hash or similarity.

### Automated Validation

 Set up logging to catch anomalies during scraping. Colly’s events (OnError, etc.) can log HTTP errors. Keep track of how many articles were scraped vs. how many were successfully processed. You could maintain a small “QA dataset” – e.g., randomly sample 1% of scraped articles and manually inspect that the content is good (or write assertions, like check that the title appears within the text, or that the text has at least one period, etc.). Another useful validation is to ensure metadata consistency: if your article metadata says “author: John Doe” but the text does not mention “John Doe” at all, maybe the author extraction failed. Often the metadata like author or date can be cross-verified (if the site includes the author name in the page text or meta tags).

### Error Correction

 Common errors include HTML character references not decoded (e.g., “&” instead of “&”), missing spaces (sometimes after stripping tags, words might concatenate if no space was there – you can fix by adding a space when a text and a <p> tag end are adjacent, for example), or misidentified content (like including a menu item in the text). Many of these can be ironed out by iterative improvements: if you notice a pattern of unwanted text in outputs (say, every article from Site X ends with “Share this: [Facebook icon] [Twitter icon]”), you can add a rule to remove those elements in the parser. Over time, your cleaning process becomes more robust for all the blogs you handle.

Finally, consider versioning and monitoring your dataset. As you plan to run this system long-term, periodically re-scrape new posts, it’s good to keep an eye on changes. If a particular blog changes its HTML structure, your extraction might start failing silently. Having unit tests or sample pages from each source and verifying the extraction output can alert you to needed adjustments. Also, maintain a log of removed duplicates or flagged content (maybe output a list of suspected duplicate pairs, so you can manually review if needed).

## Conclusion

In summary, building a local RAG-ready knowledge base from web blogs involves: a robust scraping setup (Go or TS tools each have advantages; Go’s concurrency and performance are excellent ￼, while TS has mature headless browser support), reliable content extraction to get the meat of each article (with Readability-based Go libraries to strip boilerplate ￼), careful text preprocessing (preserve meaning – don’t mutilate the text for modern embeddings ￼), smart chunking for indexing (appropriate size and overlap to balance context ￼), and continuous quality control (deduplicate with hashes/SimHash ￼, validate each step to catch errors). By following these practices, you can efficiently index thousands of blog posts locally while maintaining high data quality, which in turn will boost the accuracy and reliability of your RAG system.
